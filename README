Boot scripts for OLPC XO 1.75
=============================

Here's a couple of scripts that make it feasible/easy to run an up-to-date
Linux distribution, such as Fedora, on the ARM-based OLPC XO 1.75.

Installation
------------

They need to be copied to the boot partition's boot/ subdirectory.
OpenFirmware considers either the active partition or the first partiiton
to be the boot partition. It needs to be formatted with a ext2/3/4 or FAT
filesystem. Note that if the boot partition is separate from the root
partition, this means the the scripts will end up in /boot/boot.

On a typical Fedora ARM image, this is the partition 2. Note that the
bls.fth currently assumes that the first partition is an EFI system
partition with a GRUB installation as is the case for the Fedora images.

Contents
--------

* fixes.fth - OpenFirmware fixes. This script applies a couple of fixes to
              OpenFirmware. Most notably, it fixes the construction of the
              FDT (Flattened Device Tree) structure. Contains some more
              fixes too. This will eventually be folded into OpenFirmware.

* dt.fth    - This adjusts the device tree to be compatible with what
              mainline Linux expects. Currently it breaks boot of the OLPC
              kernels. Will also be folded into OpenFirmware once it's
              complete and the compatibility with OLPC kernels is solved.

* bls.fth   - Implements the kernel/initramfs selection that's to some
              extent compliant with the Boot Loader Specification.
              This just sets "boot-device", "boot-file" and "ramdisk".
              You can set those variable manually instead, if you wish.

* menu.fth  - A simple boot selector. Also ends up setting "boot-device",
              "boot-file" and "ramdisk". Disabled by default, useful for
              debugging.

* olpc.fth  - Main boot scripts. Sources the above and initiates the kernel
              load with the "boot" command.

Disclaimer
----------

I'm not really proficient with Forth. The quality of the code might reflect
that. I'm accepting patches.

License
-------

I'm allowing redistribution of the scripts under the terms of any of the
licenses that are permissible for OpenFirmware. To my knowledge, it's the
MIT license, BSD license or GPL. This is because some of the above code
should end up in a future OpenFirmware release.
